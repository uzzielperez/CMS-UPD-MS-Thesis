# CMS-UPD-MS-Thesis: RSG Diphoton Angular distribution and production

This is a repository for my analyzers, macros and notes for my Masters Thesis 
at the University of the Philippines, Diliman. My advisers are Dr. Jose Magpantay and 
Dr. Conor Henderson (University of Alabama)/Dr. Otman Charaf. Also helped greatly by Andrew Buccilli, and 
Dr. Chia-Ming Kuo of National Central University, Taiwan.

This is a study on RSG diphoton angular distribution and production at the LHC.
